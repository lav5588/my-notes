# NPM packages Which We Should Study for easyness of the project developement process

## 1.Chalk
##### `npm i chalk`
- It helps to customize the color of the output of the command-line output
- It helps to improve the quality of the output by providing several color options like for warning message red color and many more


## 2.Morgan

##### `npm i morgan`
- Purpose: Morgan is a logging middleware for Express. It logs HTTP requests and responses, which is useful for debugging and monitoring.
- Usage: Often used in development to log requests in the console.


## 3.After

##### `npm i after`
- Purpose: This utility helps in executing a function only after a certain number of calls. It is often used to coordinate asynchronous operations.
- Usage: For example, if you need to wait for multiple asynchronous actions to complete before proceeding, you can use after to track these actions.


## 4.connect-redis
##### `npm i connect-redis`
- Purpose: This middleware provides Redis-based session storage for applications using the express-session middleware.
- Usage: It is used to store session data in a Redis store, which is particularly useful for distributed systems where sessions need to be shared across multiple servers.

## 5.cookie-parser
##### `npm i cookie-parser`
- Parse Cookie header and populate req.cookies with an object keyed by the cookie names. Optionally you may enable signed cookie support by passing a secret string, which assigns req.secret so it may be used by other middleware.
- Purpose: This middleware parses cookies attached to the client request object. This makes it easy to access cookie data in your Express applications.
- Usage: It's typically used to read cookies for authentication and session management.


## 6.cookie-session
##### `npm i cookie-session`
- Purpose: This middleware creates session cookies using a client-side cookie, meaning session data is stored in the cookie itself, reducing server load.
- Usage: Useful for simple session management without the need for a server-side store.

## 7.ejs
##### `npm i ejs`
- Purpose: EJS is a templating engine for generating HTML markup with JavaScript. It is used to embed JavaScript code in HTML files, allowing for dynamic content rendering.
- Usage: Commonly used to render views in Express applications.

## 8.eslint
##### `npm i eslint`
- Purpose: ESLint is a linter for JavaScript code. It helps in identifying and fixing problems in your JavaScript codebase according to specified rules and style guidelines.
- Usage: It enforces coding standards and helps maintain code quality.


## 9.express-session 
##### `npm i express-session `
- Purpose: This middleware manages session data on the server-side. It is used to store user sessions, typically in memory or in a database.
- Usage: Essential for user login systems where session data like authentication tokens are needed.

- Usage: Useful in RESTful APIs where the client (like HTML forms) can only send GET or POST requests.


## 13.mocha
##### `npm i mocha`
- Purpose: Mocha is a test framework for Node.js, used for running unit tests. It provides a structured way to write tests and assert the behavior of your code.
- Usage: Commonly used in conjunction with assertion libraries like Chai.


## 14.nyc
##### `npm i nyc`
-Purpose: NYC is a code coverage tool for Node.js. It measures how much of your code is covered by tests.
- Usage: Integrated into test suites to report on test coverage.

## 15.pbkdf2-password
##### `npm i pbkdf2-password`
- Purpose: This library provides a simple API for password hashing using the PBKDF2 (Password-Based Key Derivation Function 2) algorithm.
- Usage: Used for securely storing user passwords.


## 16.supertest
##### `npm i supertest`
- Purpose: Supertest is a library for testing HTTP endpoints. It provides a high-level abstraction for writing tests for web applications.
- Usage: Commonly used to test RESTful APIs by making HTTP requests and verifying the responses.
## 13.vhost
##### `npm i vhost`
- Purpose: This middleware handles virtual hosts. It allows you to serve multiple domains from a single Express app.
- Usage: Useful for creating subdomains or multi-domain setups within an Express application.
